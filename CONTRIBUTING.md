### Setup Dev Environment

Clone the repository and run

```
npm install
```

We use a locally served version of the [demo page](https://gruhn.github.io/vue-qrcode-reader/demos/DecodeAll.html) during development. 
To get that started run

```
npm run dev
```

### Commit Messages

The version number of releases is automatically determined form commit messages. 
This only works if we follow [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#commit-message-format).
