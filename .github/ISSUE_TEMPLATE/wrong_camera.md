If your device defaults to the wrong camera, please [open this demo](https://gruhn.github.io/vue-qrcode-reader/select-camera-demo.html).
You should see a list of all cameras installed on your device.
Copy the list and mark the camera that was picked by default and the camera that should actually be picked.
For example like this:

```
FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in)     [DEFAULT]
A different Camera                [PREFERRED]
Another different Camera
```
