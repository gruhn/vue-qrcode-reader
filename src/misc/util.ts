 *
 * but from the context we know that it can actually never be `undefined`.
 * We can access attributes of `value` with
 *
 *     value?.length
 *
 * but if the assumption is actually broken, we can a silent error.
 * In contrast, with
 *
 *     assert(value !== undefined, 'reason why we assume value always defined')
 *     value.length // no type error
 *
 * We make the assumption explicit and force a laud error. Also the type
 * check can narrow the type of `value` to `string` after the `assert` and we
 * can access properties without type error.
